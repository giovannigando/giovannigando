- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giovannigando
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making real life solutions for daily tasks that deal with personal organization, learning, optimization, and other aspects that are not so intuitive for ordinary people. I really think that technology, computer programs, and creativity could make a huge difference. 

- At the moment I'm focusing on learning Web Development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have a few ideas to start working on for the following weeks. I know how to code simple Java and Python programs. Inside the repositories I don't have useful programs for you, because I didn't know about module programming and code organization to make my code readable in the future. Soon I'll upload projects relevant to Web Development, that will be readable and runnable. 

- My goal is to [learn about design, code efficiency, database, and different programming languages] to enter into the world of VR or AR and push my capabilities to another level. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Industrial Engineering, but I code as a hobby. 
- ðŸ“« I'll include an e-mail address later, after uploading the first projects.
