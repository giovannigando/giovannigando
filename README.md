- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giovannigando
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making real life solutions for daily tasks that deal with personal organization, learning, optimization, and other aspects that are not so intuitive for people. I really think that technology, computer programs, and creativity could make a huge difference. 

- Normal English Typing Speed --> 80 WPM (goal 110WPM) 

- At the moment I'm focusing on learning Web Development using Java, and SQL. I've learned already HTML, CSS,  Javascript and control Front-End frameworks, but I'm more interested on creating Back-End systems. I know how to code complex Java programs and inside the repositories I'm uploading useful programs for you. Soon I'll be uploading projects relevant to Web Development, that will be readable and runnable. 

- My goal is to [learn about code efficiency, database, design and different programming languages] and in the future to enter into the world of VR or AR and push my capabilities to another level.
