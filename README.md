- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giovannigando
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making real life solutions for daily tasks that deal with personal organization, memorization, learning, optimization, and other aspects that are not so intuitive for ordinary people. I really think that technology, computer programs, and creativity could make a huge difference. 

- The main Project Im working on now and on the next following months is about memorizing concepts and data effectively using a Memory Palace with the shortest amount of instructions. Application is called ["My Memory Palace"], then I'll improve the ["My Schedule Builder"] application and then continue with a Project that will help you considering the most important aspects and habits to focus on everyday with indicators similar to "theSims" and call it ["My Priorities"]. I'll also be reading about all the issues with these three projects to improve them as fast as possible. I am convinced "My Schedule Builder", "My Memory Palace", and "My Priorities" could save time to everybody to learn on the things that matter the most, while focusing on the other aspects of life that make you happy. 

- I call this ["The Triple Challenge"] that I hope to finish before 2022 to start using the same concepts for a group of apps that will communicate between them and help you in the future. 

- My goal is to [learn about design, code efficiency, database, and different programming languages] to enter into the world of VR or AR and push "The Triple Challenge" to another level. Maybe I could collaborate on a VR world where you could create your Memory Palaces using real places and add real animations while you walk around it. Then using the Memory Palace concepts to practice taking in front of thousands of virtual people a memorized speech while them give you feedback on your public speaking skills. This is what I love about programming. The possibilities are endless. 
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Industrial Engineering, but I code as a hobby. 
- ðŸ“« I'll include an e-mail address later, after uploading the first projects.
